# Site-to-Site Equipment Optimization - VMS Victoria 2023

## Executive Summary

Analysis of VMS equipment deployment in Victoria reveals significant cost-saving opportunities through site-to-site equipment transfers instead of depot returns.

## Dataset

- **Victoria VMS contracts**: 848 contracts with coordinates
- **Analysis period**: 2023 full year
- **Equipment type**: Variable Message Signs only
- **Geographic scope**: Victoria, Australia

## Key Findings

### Optimization Potential

- **6,832 opportunities** for site-to-site transfers identified
- **Total distance savings**: 94,739 km annually
- **Average savings per transfer**: 13.9 km
- **Annual cost savings**: $231,564 (fuel + driver costs)
- **Equipment allowance**: 10-day window for site-to-site moves

### Multiple Equipment Options

- **729 contracts** have multiple equipment choices (86% of analyzed contracts)
- **9.3 average options** per contract
- **Maximum 32 options** available for single contract
- **Equipment selection**: Prioritized by cost savings, not proximity

### Top Savings Opportunities

| From Contract | To Contract | Days Gap | Site-to-Site | Depot Distance | Savings  | % Saved |
| ------------- | ----------- | -------- | ------------ | -------------- | -------- | ------- |
| HC12765       | HC12186     | 1 day    | 0.0 km       | 338.1 km       | 338.1 km | 100%    |
| HC12128       | HC12765     | 5 days   | 92.2 km      | 338.1 km       | 245.9 km | 72.7%   |
| HC9572        | HC9998      | 6 days   | 234.4 km     | 456.6 km       | 222.2 km | 48.7%   |

### Business Impact

- **Cost reduction**: Significant fuel and transport savings
- **Equipment utilization**: Faster deployment to new sites
- **Environmental benefit**: Reduced carbon footprint
- **Operational efficiency**: Less depot handling required
- **Scheduling flexibility**: 86% of contracts have multiple equipment options
- **Risk mitigation**: Backup choices if primary equipment unavailable

## Methodology & Assumptions

### Distance & Travel

- **Distance calculation**: Euclidean (straight-line) distance
- **Actual road distance**: Estimated 1.3x straight-line distance
- **Travel speed**: 60 km/hour average
- **Depot location**: VIC ELECTRONICS (-37.6805, 145.0064)

### Cost Assumptions

- **Fuel consumption**: 12L/100km (Australian ute average)
- **Diesel price**: $1.65/litre
- **Driver cost**: $40/hour
- **Total cost per km**: $2.44 (fuel: $0.20 + driver: $2.24)

### Analysis Parameters

- **Time window**: Equipment available 10 days post-contract
- **Geographic filter**: Victoria boundaries only
- **Equipment type**: VMS units only
- **Equipment selection logic**: Ranked by cost savings (not proximity)
- **Multiple options**: Average 9.3 choices per contract

## Implementation Recommendations

1. **Prioritize high-savings transfers** (>100km savings)
2. **Monitor 0-1 day gaps** for immediate transfers
3. **Track equipment status** for optimization opportunities
4. **Route planning integration** with dispatch systems

## Contract Chain Analysis

### Chain Length Distribution
- **Length 8**: 1 chain (longest equipment flow)
- **Length 4**: 4 chains (regional operations)
- **Length 3**: 7 chains (short sequences)
- **Length 2**: 13 chains (direct transfers)

### Chain Impact
- **779 contracts** participate in chains (93% of Victoria contracts)
- **22,085 km total savings** from chained transfers
- **28.4 km average savings** per chained contract

## Operational Benefits

- **94,739 km annual savings** in Victoria alone
- **$231,564 annual cost savings** (fuel + driver)
- **30% average distance reduction** on optimized routes
- **Same-location transfers** offer 100% depot-return elimination
- **1,579 hours** saved annually (driver time)
- **Multi-day flexibility** allows scheduling optimization

### Cost Calculation

```
Total distance savings: 94,739 km
Road distance factor: 1.3x = 123,161 km
Cost per km: $2.44
Annual savings: 123,161 Ã— $2.44 = $231,564
```
