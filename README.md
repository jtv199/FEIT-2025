## Data Structures for Equipment Rental Program

This document outlines the core data structures used to manage job requests and available equipment for a rental service.

---

### 1. Job Request Data (`JobRequest`)

This structure holds all the necessary information for a single equipment rental job.

**Purpose:** To define a specific request for equipment, including its location, duration, and the type of equipment needed.

**Fields:**

*   **`job_id`** (Integer / String): A unique identifier for this particular job request.
    *   *Example:* `1001`, `JOB-2023-005`
*   **`location_gps`** (Tuple / Object: `(latitude, longitude)`): The geographical coordinates where the equipment is required.
    *   *Example:* `(34.0522, -118.2437)` (Los Angeles)
*   **`start_time`** (DateTime): The exact date and time when the equipment is needed to begin the job.
    *   *Example:* `2023-10-26 08:00:00`
*   **`end_time_projected`** (DateTime): The estimated date and time when the equipment will no longer be needed for the job. This is a projected end and might be subject to change.
    *   *Example:* `2023-10-28 17:00:00`
*   **`equipment_needed`** (List of Strings / Enums): A list specifying the types or categories of equipment requested for this job. This could be general types (e.g., "excavator", "generator") or more specific model types.
    *   *Example:* `["Excavator (Small)", "Generator (50kW)", "Safety Barriers"]`

**Example `JobRequest` Object:**

```json
{
    "job_id": "JOB-NYC-001",
    "location_gps": (40.7128, -74.0060),
    "start_time": "2023-11-15T09:00:00Z",
    "end_time_projected": "2023-11-20T16:00:00Z",
    "equipment_needed": ["Forklift (Heavy Duty)", "Pallet Jack"]
}
```

### 2. Equipment Data (`RentalEquipment`)

This structure represents an individual piece of equipment available for rent.

**Purpose:** To track specific equipment items, their unique identification, and their current booking status.

**Fields:**

*   **`equipment_id`** (String): A unique identifier for this specific piece of equipment across the entire inventory.
    *   *Example:* `EQ-EXC-001`, `GEN-456-A`
*   **`equipment_type`** (String): The general category or model of the equipment. This helps match equipment to job requests.
    *   *Example:* `"Excavator (Small)"`, `"Generator (50kW)"`, `"Scissor Lift"`
*   **`current_location_gps`** (Tuple / Object: `(latitude, longitude)`): The current physical location of the equipment. This is crucial for calculating transportation costs and time.
    *   *Example:* `(34.0522, -118.2437)` (Warehouse A)
*   **`bookings`** (List of Objects `BookingSlot`): A list of scheduled time periods when this equipment is already reserved. Each booking will specify a start and end time.
    *   *Example:*
        ```json
        [
            {"start": "2023-10-20T09:00:00Z", "end": "2023-10-22T17:00:00Z", "booked_by_job_id": "JOB-LA-003"},
            {"start": "2023-11-01T08:00:00Z", "end": "2023-11-05T18:00:00Z", "booked_by_job_id": "JOB-SF-007"}
        ]
        ```

**Nested Structure for `BookingSlot`:**

*   **`start`** (DateTime): The start date and time of the booking.
*   **`end`** (DateTime): The end date and time of the booking.
*   **`booked_by_job_id`** (String): The `job_id` of the job request that has booked this slot. (Optional, but highly recommended for traceability).

**Example `RentalEquipment` Object:**

```json
{
    "equipment_id": "EXC-SMALL-789",
    "equipment_type": "Excavator (Small)",
    "current_location_gps": (33.9500, -117.9000), // Near a depot
    "bookings": [
        {
            "start": "2023-10-26T08:00:00Z",
            "end": "2023-10-28T17:00:00Z",
            "booked_by_job_id": "JOB-NYC-001"
        }
    ]
}
```
